@Betsy_June These people need to learn to read government boilerplate. FDA just gave full approval for adults to the Moderna COVID vaccine, which will now be known as SpikeVax. Post implies this is a different vaccine than the one given an EUA in Dec. 2020. It is not.

But‚Ä¶ why? There‚Äôs no clinical utility of Covid-19 antibody test. https://t.co/Qux8wsvB8O

How repulsive. Had we listened to the 'open it up' fringe, we would've had thousands of Covid dead.

No billboards of all the people that were saved by policies that put public health first.

Public health success is sadly, invisible and taken for granted. https://t.co/5VvSQZz1Zz

So, basically vaccinated people can still get Covid and spread it and kill people ? The vaccine is for personal protection against serious complications of Covid then ? Not a mean to end the pandemic, can anybody explain why is it such a big deal if people don‚Äôt to?
@MSNBC You freaking idiots. It's a known fact that that vaccine does not work against Covid.

@Rob_Smithers @Ataraxi64995427 @lux_schwab Sorry you need to actually understand the numbers not subscribe to the fear porn. You need to look at excess mortatlity 460 people die everyday in Australia if 30 people died of COVID and that number went to 490 then that would be excess mortatlity but hasn't happened

So what's the Biden admin supposed to do, go after the most popular podcaster in world history and double-down on the COVID panic, during an election year when they're about to declare COVID a non-issue? Or go against their idiot base who they've got in a lather on COVID?
@drlizzieskinner Covid is an opportunistic respiratory pathogen with an up to 99.97% recovery rate ... most people are fine ... get used to it ...
@RaffaeleRanier8 @2021Giancarlo @barbarab1974 Il trattamento inutile tiene gli ospedali sotto controllo, meno del 10% di non vaccinati occupano l'80% dei ricoveri da covid delle terapie intensive ed i due terzi di quelli ordinari.
@RepFredKeller When the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) made the COVID-19  virus, it also made the antidote. The CCP has an antidote.
Take down the ccp!!!
@mass_casualty @calebmaupin Was it win-win cooperation when CCP unleashed COVID upon the whole world? The rest of the world loses when China rises.
@Hellsbellsmac I only see them for gay and black people . I now assume I have no risk for aids and wore a condom for nothing. Lol jk I didn't. But I am less worried about covid than aids.

@Cheese12987 I recently had a doctor try to offer the coronavirus "vaccine". I told her that I already had covid and that I didn't need it for a disease that I've already been infected with. With my current unrelated health issues getting "vaccinated" could only make them worse. No thanks!

@NZMistressV Well, it's normal to get a jab every year for the flu because flu strains often change and the efficacy doesn't last forever. I see that eventually when the severity of covid drops to similar levels as the flu it'll be something that's added into your yearly flu jab.

Because there was no sensitive PCR testing and because long COVID isn't clear cut, there is no way to know for sure

Yet we still hear is "get vaccinated to avoid serious illness". 

Is death not serious now?

This set of selected individual cards would generate a Covid Character Card. 

Which is either a text version of all your covid info with emojis like I had in the 1st tweet or a designed/laid out card that someone could download and share.
A Covid Card site would be pretty plain, kinda like wordle. 

It would just be cards that you select, like let me click click click.. for my 3 Pfizer Penguin familiars.

2) 100% #vaccination NEVER eradicates a zoonotic virus...

@adamj2015 @FaWonderer @katrosenfield .... you cant just ignore that away, because you made the decision that you are some Hero for getting vaccinated, thats a very privileged perspective, punishing working/poor family people for hesitating covid immunization is not a solution, its just a medical discrimination.

@desgoslett He could also more easily spread covid if he has it, to *other people*. So for the millionth time, we wear masks to do as much as we can to protect the people around us, some of whom can get very sick and even die. No mask around people = selfish prick.

@anagabriela_ns @SimplySomeGuy @MurkoffsBitch @OccupyDemocrats You're being sarcastic, I hope. A 7 day average shows 2500 Americans a day are dying of Covid-19, and many hospitals are overwhelmed. If this is your idea of normal, I'd hate to see your definition of out of control.

COVID sucks, yeah, but nowhere near as other illnesses/issues I've faced, and unfortunately like *any* virus for some people that virus will be lethal.

But most of all I am still baffled at how perfectly healthy people are so terrified of COVID and expect everyone to vaccine and mask up while I'm over here just living life, maskless and unvaccinated.
Someone asked me why I share the fact that I have Auto Immune Diseases when I also state that my COVID vaccination status is no one's business.  Fair question, I share it because while I am more at risk from complications from COVID I refuse to be terrified.
@OldsodC @gina_velong @pnjaban 1.) Wrong, unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women of all colors was at historically low levels, and real wage growth for the same categories was way up.

@bschillace Between COVID, global warming, plastics, water scarcity and social unrest (among others), it certainly feels like it on occasion. We survived most of it before so I hope we will again. I choose obliviousness often, so I can enjoy my time here, then feel guilty-great cycle (not).
I hope that the person who recorded the Scream bootleg that I watched is okay. There was a lot of coughing in the theater and a couple of those people definitely had COVID.

@lindastern @CDCgov @CDCMMWR That is a very good question, but too many variables and it would skew the desired results of unmasked individuals getting covid. If we were to add vaccinations we would have to account for how many caught covid while being vaccinated and nobody wants to discuss that.
@BobMurphyEcon @ComicDaveSmith I think on an individual basis if you were really fearful of Covid, you could follow a n95 mask protocol that results in reduced risk to yourself. However, the level of diligence required cannot be reasonably expected of most ppl, so it‚Äôs not a tool to significantly reduce spread

@LoganMBooker Glad you are okay. That looks scary wow. Wearing a seatbelt and having airbags are kinda like getting a Covid Vac- it won‚Äôt prevent you from getting hurt in the accident- but have a much better chance of keeping you out of a hospital for weeks or a cemetery forever.
@TheTweetOfRhea I like your posts. You follow the covid #'s (so do I), and you're very smart!

@Kit_Yates_Maths Interesting, but when will we admit enforcing school attendance whilst covid rips thru schools (infecting some families 3rd time, causing long covid &amp; hospitalising children at an uncomfortable rate) without mitigating or offering vaccination to &lt;12s is wrong? #MakeSchoolsSafe

Are they pro actively working in improving their lots by financing some real research for the better of all?

@caruzycki What I'm hearing is mostly that masks harm kids, and that there's no proof that masks prevent the spread of covid. I work in health care and in an office of 20+ people, 2 are still wearing respirators, even when performing AGPs. They say the respirators are too uncomfortable.

@unseen1_unseen Glad you‚Äôre doing ok. Sure sounds similar to the Covid that came through our house. I had mild symptoms but never tested positive either. Hope you‚Äôre on the mend soon.
I am defining people who aren't boostered as semi-vaxxed and people who aren't wearing N95s or equivalent as semi-masked. 

This distinction has been really missing in a lot of covid info.

@Ordinary_jo_jo @NZ17Free Yes, I did read it.
Those figures suggest only 0.002% of people have some sort of adverse reaction. In NZ its even less. The hospitals are not reporting anything of concern. Certainly nowhere near as bad as covid reactions.
This vaccine is incredibly safe and it works.

@hoop_skip @MarcUK19 @deblvsbabygroot @lux_schwab Firstly that‚Äôs not true. Secondly even if it were true, covid has been around for two solid years.

@LadyCaroline69 @DrShaneRRR It's the same with COVID-19 although the best way to prevent risk from that is to stay home, although that is a substantial drain and it takes a lot away. The other methods for reducing are not so clear cut and are questionable in their effectiveness on a population scale.

@DaveCasto4 Science is evolving. Vaccines have shown that they prevent severe symptoms and result in lower death rates. 

I believe that this is not a "vaccine" in what we know them to be and should be referenced more in line with a "covid shot" (similar to a flu shot) and not a vaccine

Here is a sample: 25 people I know. From this we can conclude if rarely wear a mask you won't get Covid. Who cares that it wasn't random and I didn't ask about behavior, vax status &amp; only 1 rarely used mask? There is no bias right? Any similarities to CDC study?

@DianneCallaha16 @BoHines You do know that even if 100% of all humans on earth were vaccinated, Covid variants would continue to emerge. Why? Bec Covid has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get it.

@Bearistotle1 @judgecapri @SAADougNance1 @bennyjohnson Amazing how vaxxers (not vaccine takers) think they are immune. You can get and spread Covid.

@RonFilipkowski @sirDukeDevin Best President in our lifetime.

@millennials4_wp @CandiceBergenMP @DaytonF How are the restrictions keeping people safe when the vaccinated can get and spread Covid? I personally know many vaccinated people who now have Covid. What has the segregation of the population done other than to cause divisiveness?
@Juicytubesmile @kevinbrown137 @Caitlyn_Jenner @joerogan @Spotify Joe believes that covid vaccines have negative long term effects. For us, covid is worse, so we vaccinate. for him the unknown is worse, so he doesn't. for us what he says may cause harm. for him, what we say may cause harm. He has the same right than us to express his concern.
Apparently the idea of knowing that since of who is not getting their way is rather amusing if I go get two nights at a motel for the idea I dont have Covid 19 at the Serenity House Shelter knowing this is the only free place to crash since I am a on purpose loner #IAmDR #WA #Lol

GREAT NEWS! A federal judge in Texas just blocked the unconstitutional COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal employees. 

Our office was the first to challenge Biden's unlawful mandates. We will continue to fight to protect your liberties.

@victoriaalavine Otherwise no symptoms. I was more tired then than when we all had covid in the house...You know, I took test after test each said I was negative. Third or fourth test said I had it although I felt excellent. We quarantined but i never felt great, mine was false positive perhaps?

@canadiangirls99 I would like to have been able to afford a private jet during Covid because they did not have the same testing, restrictions, etc. Politicians &amp; rich people took them, NOT AFRAID to travel, while trying to keep us scared, imprisoned &amp; fearful. üò°
Meanwhile, readers from the west condescend to them for 'spending money on pets' and how 'the covid restrictions are to save lives.'

They're not fleeing Covid! Most are fleeing because they work in news and academic fields that speak out against China and have been threatened
//I hate political news on sites like Twitter. Bloomberg trying to 'click-bait' and trivialize people fleeing Chinese occupied Honk Kong to a matter of 'pets and covid restriction' while not mentioning the huge human rights issues as China strips them of democratic rights.
@OttawaPolice @gofundme You should be ashamed of yourselves... you did nothing when people marched against racism (which is a good thing to protest) DURING THE WORST PART OF COVID. 
You are partisan. Its obvious.

Very good recommendations.
Reinforces my personal bottom line:

@DennisKendel @PremierScottMoe Hospitals are under strain cause you have staff &amp; facility shortages! You have for a DECADE or longer!!!!

Hi üëã @POTUS @OMBPress Please request $17 billion in supplemental funding to defeat COVID-19 globally. We can only end this pandemic by acting together and going the last mile to vaccinate the world. #EndThePandemic https://t.co/Jvb4BjaFUB
@BasicBishopNZ That sucks. I don't mean to sound callous, just a genuine question. Do you think it is okay for unvaxxed people, even healthy and those who have already recovered from covid, to continue to be marginalised in society? And fired from their jobs? If so, for how long?

Clue: max daily Covid deaths and max new case numbers in highly Pfizer vaccinated Israel came after mass vaccination was achieved.

@cadria04 Don't they have to win first? And then there will be a counter suit. You know this stuff takes a long time, and courts are backed up over covid.

It's probably just easier if the government complies.
@GregReetz @erinbrasher @donotcommentthx @cnnbrk Surgeons don‚Äôt wear N95s, which was the joke you were referring to that left everyone slapping their knees, but clearly had to backpedal on that. You should wear an N95 with a surgical mask on top and get your fourth shot, so you can still contract and spread COVID.

@linseymarr That mask you‚Äôre wearing doesn‚Äôt stop covid
@llhenriksen @9NEWS Hopefully long before COVID you wore one too. Because long before COVID every virus out there (flu/colds) are just as risky for your loved one.

@PrimaryALLRINO There is blood on their hands for making things like Ivermectin available.  My 80 year old parents just got over Covid using Ivermectin which showed a remarkable improvement in 24 hours.  They know it works but refuse to put it out there.   It's criminal.
@fslsltn Considering this difficulty, Travel Canada has updated its entry requirements to having positive PCR atleast 10 days prior to travel for fully vaccinated travellers.This means, that even if one gets COVID +ve, 10 (to 180) days prior to travel, they can still enter Canada

@unusual_whales Rubbish, these were jobs closed down during the covid crisis, they are not new jobs. Lies, lies and statistics.
@HEBabuOwino Early as May 2021, HELB said it did not have money. Loan repayments were not coming as employees lost their jobs due to Covid. At the same time, the budget cut the allocation of money to HELB. Did @HEBabuOwino protest in Parliament? Did he vote "No" for that budget that cut HELB?
@theworst1011 @ColumbiaBugle Paul isn‚Äôt anti-vaccine.  He‚Äôs basing his personal choice off natural immunity. He‚Äôs being painted that way because of his investigation into the origins of Covid. Dude he performs eye surgeries. He‚Äôs a doctor. People should be questioning the origins, research and funding.

Krn semua vaksin covid yg ada skrg terlalu terburu-buru dibikinnya. Dalam hitungan hari, sudah muncul vaksinnya. Padahal normalnya butuh waktu 12 tahun, itupun dgn tingkat keberhasilan sebesar 2% saja (disebutkan begitu di ulasan makalah Stephanie Seneff)

@usidramki123 @DrEricDing @JohnsHopkins @GidMK Yes - all this. In 2020 I saw a social post from a former coworker, complaining that "the government is hurting small businesses!"....I tried to explain. Not more than a month later, her mother (apparently a VOCAL antivaxxer) died of covid! Can't make this stuff up.
@GidMK My read of the climate:

Social scientists need to go w/assumption that proper masking/vax/other measures work... from a physical science POV.

Physical scientists need to go w/assumption that policy decisions re:covid response are main drivers of data from here.

@Elorador5 @docbarda @Brunocalabres @tavos Q f√°cil es hablar sin saber. Se usa para intubaciones, con el COVID aumento el n√∫mero de intubaciones, por ende la demanda. El aumento de demanda suele aumentar el precio, por lo tanto si se importo m√°s es por esta dos razones.
@McMannKrtaylor3 @jkenney @CMOH_Alberta @JasonCoppingAB Boy you can really tell who only follows MSM on here.... 1- there are no field hospitals working 2- icu rates are stable and beds filled are lower than in 2019 3- 40% of the Covid hospitalizations are actually there for covid, the rest are incidental.

@KRMartin15 @19_scorpiology No! Omicron bypassed the vaccine, meaning those who were vaccinated still got it as it didn‚Äôt protect them against this new variant

I know a lot of double jabbed people who have caught Covid since Omicron became prevalent. I‚Äôm sure you do too!
I‚Äôve survived this twice along w/the ‚ù§Ô∏è attack it brought on. So many of my friends, co-workers, millions of others have not.

@johnb78 @SteveKiely7 @ZBasyouny Ah fair enough.. so maybe then we also may need to look at excess mortality with previous years at some point for a fair comparison to see if it was actually from covid or with covid as well.

‚ÄùThe Omicron variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Delta variant. CDC expects that anyone with Omicron infection can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or don‚Äôt have symptoms.‚Äù

Perlu diingat, data ini diambil pada saat dunia mengalami tekanan ekonomi akibat Covid-19. Pada saat ini seluruh negara mengalami pembengkakan rasio utang. 

Ini artinya upaya pemerintah dalam mengendalikan rasio utang berada pada jalur yang tepat.

@VenerableDonkey @Ahhmandah @dairymanNZ As I understand it, the trends predate the introduction of the vaccines. The likely cause seems to be inadequacies in how Covid deaths are assessed, deaths from longer term Covid complications and some connected to degraded health system

@jennd33 @OttawaPolice @gofundme The government told the people the vaccines were the answer - there are more people getting covid now that the vaccine regimen is in place than before there was a vaccine, including 3-jabbed Trudeau. The mandates are pointless and tyrannical and somebody has finally said ENOUGH!
@Cryptowolfchat @SeekTiger COVID 19 has slowed many economies around the world but as a crypto business has it affected you negatively or positively? Secondly, are you still on track to achieve your targets as the road map says?
@Tom_Maguire @RepThomasMassie @US_FDA @pfizer The Prep Act is very important for Pfizer to get though as it will give them future immunity from liability for covid vaccine injuries once the health emergency is over. Thus the push to vaccinate the kids &amp; get the Prep Act immunity whether the kids need it or not. Correct ?

His COVID views are not the reason many people, including me, find him problematic. It‚Äôs his hate-filled rhetoric.
@Rachel51708387 @hoffer_gena @jkenney You‚Äôd say that, but it has never happened. With Covid, it has. If the unvaxxed would just stop going to the hospital we could end all mandates.

@ucjobee @KatieBrittforAL @michaeljknowles No. I was reading the Lancet and other scientific journals. I was prepared for Covid before the US started public health measures.

His family members said the hospital didn't let them take the body, they started inquiring and then they found it was because it was marked as a Covid death. WTF
@MSNBC First the vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission. Second healthy kids rarely have serious cases of Covid. Third, the most vaccinated and boosted nations on earth have the highest infection, hospitalization, and death rates on earth. Dr. Emmanuel is a shill quack.

@channingj @DaveDanger_ Wow, talk about the point going over your head, its that the risk is not the same for all period.

@newscomauHQ @HC_Muscleman Anyone who supports vax mandates for COVID vaccines, particularly now (after seeing the mortality rate, the vaccinated still spread It, &amp; boosters required every 3 odd months to provide any protection), is a bedwetting fkwit.

@thelitigator247 @CDCDirector @CDCMMWR ‚Äú to lower your risk of getting severely ill and dying of Covid-19,‚Äù the doctors on Mr Biden‚Äôs team wrote.‚Äù

In context, it says ‚Äúin the trials‚Äù
If we use the same logic that we use for covid for other things then it would sound something like this;
- no cars allowed to drive above 40km to prevent hospitalisation 
- no knives or sharp things to be sold anywhere 
- no tramping or climbing too risky 
- no alcohol too risky

Propelled in part by low #vaccination rates &amp; the wildly contagious #Omicron variant, the U.S. #death toll from COVID-19 hit 900,000 on Friday, less than two months after eclipsing 800,000.

Jack kept saying that the COVID-19 came from Fort Detrick, and now I have to tell him: you're right!

the loop when it comes to why everyone is hating on China. I mean, I understand why they werent very popular during the start of COVID (they handled it very very poorly). Is it because Putin and their president are BFFS? And something about genocide?

@DDMADelhi1 #don'treopenschools this is totally wrong that during exams you guys said that schools are reopening is it our fault that due to COVID everything messed up but taking online classes and having offline exams like what do you exactly expect?!?!?!?
@DGHisham We know the vaccine works since mid- last year. So why are our borders closed still? We cant do anymore than today and covid won‚Äôt get any less than today. Cases will always be high. So what‚Äôs the plan to open borders? If not now then when?

Does it mean that the current Covid vaccines are useless? 
No, the main merit of current vaccines is to provide protection against severe disease, hospitalization, &amp; death. We know this protection is provided by our T cells‚Äîthe last defence against the invading virus.  13/
Covid has triggered an exponential rise in mental health issues among vulnerable population groups. Even FM @nsitharaman recognised it while presenting the #UnionBudget2022.

I repeat‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre that terrified of the covid‚Ä¶ stay the fuck at home!!!

Don‚Äôt go yelling at people to wear masks and distance and make sure their vaxx passes are checked. Just stay home and you avoid all of the problems with other humans. Everything can be delivered to you

@ntvuganda Every one should resist this with almost ferocity. If passed, ugandans will have been condemned into guinea-pigs for big corporations' vaccine trials. Besides what is the use of the consent form one is supposed to fill prior to a covid jab if people are being coarsed?

@RealJeff45 The three big ones on COVID are still up. 

Peter McCullough, dr Malone, and John Abramson. 

All from the last month or so.
if you haven't watched all three, go watch now .
Next lot of sob stories - people catching Covid while travelling.  Get to see inside of a hospital with full ICUs
look at this. Countdown moaning about mask exemptions.   How about treating people properly with valid exemptions instead discriminating against them and moaning to media.

@TheTorontoSun More idiotic logic, first liberal nuts said you can get covid off surfaces, currency, through the eyes, and even with SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE showing these things do not work because everyone will get omicron; face masks, lockdowns and vaccine passports &amp; mandates do NOT work
@Dct_Capital @omnia_protocol @TheDaoMaker COVID 19 has slowed down many economies around the world but as a crypto business, does it affect you negatively or positively? Are you still on track to achieve your goals or are you planning a new development?

@ClarenceSpeaks @RegentSamael @ezralevant Already told you to get your facts straight. 

And the topic is not about a pandemic, it's about the efficacy of this "vaccine". 

Which is zero, more cases than ever, more deaths from covid than before the "vaccination".

Get yourself a brain.
