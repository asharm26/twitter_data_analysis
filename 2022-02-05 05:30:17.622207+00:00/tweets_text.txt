So, basically vaccinated people can still get Covid and spread it and kill people ? The vaccine is for personal protection against serious complications of Covid then ? Not a mean to end the pandemic, can anybody explain why is it such a big deal if people don‚Äôt to?
@MSNBC You freaking idiots. It's a known fact that that vaccine does not work against Covid.
In case anyone didn‚Äôt realise, your government has got into bed with corporate interests at the WEF. They have sold you and your country out for personal gain. Vote them out hard. #COVID #scamdemic #TruckersForFreedom2022 #NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere

@ghoppe @ksorbs Yes it is, but in responding to what was said, for 98% of the population, natural immunity is enough to survive covid. Apparently, 2% of the population "need" the vaccination to survive.
@KCRyan69 @kylenabecker No one will be required to get an emergency vaccination with this new one. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôll never have to worry about Covid again if you get it.
