Solo in Italia i morti di Covid non calano. Gli esperti: contiamoli a cazzo come altrove, togliendo i nonnini morti per la saturazione del sistema ospedaliero, e il problema sarà risolto, sarà anche un successo notevole di comunicazione sui budget.

@bennythn Haha klart det finns dem som testar fel. Men har tagit tre test denna veckan då jag har en stundande förlossning och då är det (sjukt nog) en fördel att ha dokumenterat i 1177 om man nyligen haft covid. Noll symtom, så tvivlar starkt på att 3 test samt mitt mående skulle vara fel

@ContraPoints said "Maybe we all just need a better attitude. COVID could be a blessing in disguise. Maybe loneliness is good, actually. Sadness—underrated. To an optimist, despair is opportunity. I love death". Nothing you said about it looks like a blessing. Anticlimax story.

In my honest opinion, I can’t see multiple sequels releasing same gen due to Covid of any game. I’m not talking ports , I’m talking fresh entries built for this gen. I think Covid has so far extended this gen 3 years as well , don’t count on PS6 this decade

@Rob_Smithers @Ataraxi64995427 @lux_schwab Sorry you need to actually understand the numbers not subscribe to the fear porn. You need to look at excess mortatlity 460 people die everyday in Australia if 30 people died of COVID and that number went to 490 then that would be excess mortatlity but hasn't happened
Udah 2022 tapi Covid masih aja 19. Macam Dewa saja.
So what's the Biden admin supposed to do, go after the most popular podcaster in world history and double-down on the COVID panic, during an election year when they're about to declare COVID a non-issue? Or go against their idiot base who they've got in a lather on COVID?
@drlizzieskinner Covid is an opportunistic respiratory pathogen with an up to 99.97% recovery rate ... most people are fine ... get used to it ...
@RaffaeleRanier8 @2021Giancarlo @barbarab1974 Il trattamento inutile tiene gli ospedali sotto controllo, meno del 10% di non vaccinati occupano l'80% dei ricoveri da covid delle terapie intensive ed i due terzi di quelli ordinari.
@RepFredKeller When the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) made the COVID-19  virus, it also made the antidote. The CCP has an antidote.
Take down the ccp!!!
@mass_casualty @calebmaupin Was it win-win cooperation when CCP unleashed COVID upon the whole world? The rest of the world loses when China rises.
@Hellsbellsmac I only see them for gay and black people . I now assume I have no risk for aids and wore a condom for nothing. Lol jk I didn't. But I am less worried about covid than aids.
