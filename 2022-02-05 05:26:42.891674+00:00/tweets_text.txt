@ArgyriM @cyclopean_V @TGloyalty @Adeimantus2 @RupertLowe10 The guy says covid vaccines stop infections, every scientist now admits that is not true.  Anyone with half a brain could tell that wasn‚Äôt true by April 2021
@YouAreLobbyLud @ItsBouquet He isn't as practised in front of the camera as his predecessor who headed numerous PH emergency responses, he should have said children, in general, don't get as sick as the elderly, particularly with Covid and that is evident.
'80% of serious COVID cases are fully vaccinated' says Ichilov hospital director | Israel National News - Arutz Sheva https://t.co/e3G9rm6ZjL
@JoyaAdvocates @jackhall5 @FoxNews Lying. Everything anti-vaxers say is a lie. All their claims are fake, all their cures don't work and all their authorities are grifters selling snake oil, horse paste, magic dirt &amp; colloidal silver. 
Fact: 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.

Parents who thought their children under 5 would have to wait several more months for COVID-19 vaccinations instead just might get them as early as March. https://t.co/RBOAdfZU55

Covid finally found us thanks to two very selfish people who refused to get vaccinated or wear masks at my spouse's work. Everyone at his work now has covid. The thing that makes me so mad is that he's high risk and they know it and still refused to wear a damn maskü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

@lejjel @SParnis Young and live long after TIAs or an AMI. If covid was the contributing factor to your demise then it's covid. Furthermore, there are people who have recovered from severe covid but are now dying from complications of multi organ damage. Are they counted as covid deaths?

@NZMistressV Well, it's normal to get a jab every year for the flu because flu strains often change and the efficacy doesn't last forever. I see that eventually when the severity of covid drops to similar levels as the flu it'll be something that's added into your yearly flu jab.

@NeilWC2010 @19_scorpiology It is to do with so many unvax Covid patients taking over the beds! If they were all vaxxed you would have had around 20% occupying needed beds. You aren't vaccinated &amp; therefore are a potential risk to be hospitalised &amp; take up a bed unnecessarily if you were braver &amp; unselfish.
