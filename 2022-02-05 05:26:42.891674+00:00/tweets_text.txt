@NewRiverInvest @conorsen @pearkes The other two parts, I think I’m seeing a little differently. Specifically in the SE US.

@MoneyMoneyBucks @fraxiommusic Link the part of the podcast because I'm not listening to those whackos ramble on for 3 hours about covid conspiracies and how women are a "dragon of chaos". Also why should I trust Jordan Peterson. What reason do I have to take his words at face value?
@GOPChairwoman 18,000 Americans died preventable Covid deaths this past week. Most of them anti-vaccination Republicans. Republican leadership, including you, continues to cull GOP voters by not refuting Right wing disinformation and by not promoting the vaccine, booster and masks.
Looks like there is a lot of post-lockdown anxiety and other psychological issues out there - adults and school kids. Covid has many long tails.

@AlgernonWrites When did they debunk the "unsubstantiated rumors" that lockdowns, remote learning, and mask mandates would bring more harm to our kids than Covid ever would.  Answer, they never did.  It wasn't even a consensus opinion among experts.  The media said it was but that was a lie.
@npaoser @GiovaQuez Bisogna tristemente far convivere i morti di covid con i "morti di fame", intesi come lavoratori e imprese. Cio che è mancato di più è stata una visione a lungo termine. Siamo andati a tentoni, ma posso capirlo, visto che era un secolo che non vivevamo una pandemia simile.

@hampa80 @BalonkuLim15 @IrmaDamayanti__ @ProfesorZubairi Ini salah satu bentuk memodelkan masalah yang kurang cermat. Untuk membuktikan tuduhan "long covid hanya disebabkan obat", tidak bisa menggunakan hypothesis "tidak minum obat dan tidak bergejala" buat menyimpulkan. Yang diuji adalah null-hypothesis dari sample yg minum obat.

@gatfield_matt @BNafid3 @henglung @Stephmiccy So what. A double jabbed man in his 30’s with no health complications died from covid last week. You really want to play tit for tat? What about all the people dying from the jab itself? Jabbed under 60’s in England are dying at twice the rate of the unjabbed from all causes now
@MomoStJohn @Catteeya @LexRegina72 Yeah ideally motorists would think about how much less convincing this narrative would be if each of the (53 so far) Covid deaths were plastered on a billboard (and also that it'd be weird if the government did that).

@Out5p0ken @Curmudgeon56 I don’t even watch the news, anymore. Nothing has changed. But the death rate. How fortunate I am that no one I love has died from this. They’ve gotten covid but everyone is alive.
Schools got $190 billion in COVID relief from the feds. What’s happened to it? - Chalkbeat https://t.co/htE9gDavTY
And our current society is overvaluing the old.

They're a very strong voting block -- we absolutely shower them in tax subsidies.  Kids with negligible COVID risk stopped going to school for them.

But the lives of the elderly deserve little moral weight, compared to the young.

Covid finally found us thanks to two very selfish people who refused to get vaccinated or wear masks at my spouse's work. Everyone at his work now has covid. The thing that makes me so mad is that he's high risk and they know it and still refused to wear a damn mask🤬🤬🤬

@ksorbs Your freedoms are NOT under assault. Your concern for your freedom is being capitalized on. The unvaxxed are the overwhelming majority of covid deaths. But so long as they contribute enough before they die it's politically profitable.

@NZMistressV Well, it's normal to get a jab every year for the flu because flu strains often change and the efficacy doesn't last forever. I see that eventually when the severity of covid drops to similar levels as the flu it'll be something that's added into your yearly flu jab.
